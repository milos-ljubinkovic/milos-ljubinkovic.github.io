# Self-owned link list website

## Why
Ever wanted to own 

Buy domain
Github pages? Template quick

Philosophically owning your own part of the internet instead of being under someone's yoke

First step toward having your own site

Without a static ip and an always running computer impossible to be independent. But closest if you own dnas domain and have several options where to point them

Github completely free, your code and errors must be public

S3 almost free, but not quite, infinite scaling possibilities
